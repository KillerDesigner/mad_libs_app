MadLibs HW - WDI

This app demonstrates use of AJAX in a Rails app to create a single page app using unobtrusive JavaScript.

Your app should have a simple form that takes a noun, a verb, a proper noun, and an adjective. The user will enter these items in the input boxes and press submit, which will cause a fully formed random sentence to appear. Fun!

You will provide the sentence structure, so think about what tense the verbs need to be, and in what order the parts of speech will go into your sentence. You can use the same sentence. In version 2 consider randomly selected sentences!

Please style your app using either your own CSS or Twitter Bootstrap. Your form should include basic error checking so a user cannot submit a blank form.
