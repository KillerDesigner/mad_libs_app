MadLibs HW

This app demonstrates use of AJAX in a Rails app to create a single page app. 

Your app should have a simple form that takes a noun, a verb, a proper noun, and an adjective. The user will enter these items in the input boxes and press submit, which will cause a fully formed random sentence to appear. Fun!

This code should look very familiar. Please take some time to style your app using either your own CSS or Twitter Bootstrap.

For extra credit please create Mocha tests for your app!
